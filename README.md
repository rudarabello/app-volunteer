## Description

This app helps you and your team get organized and achieve your goals

## Motivation

The main motivation for doing this personal project was to see the need for the team of volunteers that I am part of, with difficulties to organize themselves when we have many people on more than one work front. 

#### We have three levels

    * [ ] admim - He is the manager of several work fronts. He can create a new job front, view the created job fronts and delete a job front.
    * [ ] manager - He is responsible for a work front. He creates the schedules and makes changes to the schedules when necessary
    * [ ] volunteer - He is the most important member of the team! He accepts the invitations and is able to view the accepted invitations

### See the examples:

- A volunteer is collaborating in reception and parking on the same day at different times

    * in this case the app can help the volunteer with a reminder

- A volunteer cannot go at the time they had initially made available

    * in this case the app provides a tool to notify the leader
